# üßô‚Äç‚ôÇÔ∏è Druid

A **blazingly fast**, **collision-resistant**, **sortable**, unique identifier generator written in Rust.

## üîß How It Works

Druid IDs are 40 bytes in total, composed of four parts:

1. **Timestamp** (16 bytes): Stored in big-endian format for natural sortability.
2. **Randomness** (23 bytes): Generated using a cryptographically secure pseudo-random number generator (CSPRNG).
3. **Version** (1 byte): Reserved for versioning and future compatibility.

## üéØ Collision Probability

While a theoretical chance of collision exists, it's *astronomically* low. Druid has around **2¬π‚Å∏‚Å¥ unique IDs** for each nano-second.

To put that into perspective:

> You would need to generate approximately **5.55 √ó 10¬≤‚Å∂ IDs per nanosecond** to reach a **1% chance of collision**.

That‚Äôs more IDs than grains of sand on Earth.
